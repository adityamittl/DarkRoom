# DarkRoom

## 💡 Inspiration

Do you love puzzles or treasure hunts? or pharaohs you are a big fan of Jigsaw and Escape Room movies? We have something for you!
Due to COVID'19, we are not able to go out due to some restrictions and we want to play games that are fun and let you explore them. Therefore we have created a game called DarkRoom. Here you can enter into the world of 3D puzzles and try to solve them by finding out the objects present there.

## 💻 What it does

DarkRoom is a web application that allows you to enter into the 3D world of the game Escape Room. Here users need to enter the room and see the 3D world of the game. The user can also interact with the 3D world and need to find the exit with the correct combination of the keys provided by the game by decoding the riddles. The app has tons of easter eggs and fun features. Unlock the secret parts of the game by solving the riddles and finding the exit and coming at the top of the leaderboard.

## ⚙️ How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Three Js: For 3D model rendering
- Redux: For state management
- Firebase: For user authentication
- Linode: For hosting and for storing our data

## ☁️ Use of Linode

We have a dedicated Linode server for our backend. We use it for hosting our website and for storing our data. Linode Block Storage allows users to extend their server storage capacity with volumes on demand. Linode Backup allows us to back up their servers on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis which makes it easy and efficient. Linode allows users to manage multiple server instances across a single system.

## ⛅ Use of Google Cloud

We are using Firebase for database and authentication. Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable real-time, high-performance database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Firebase is a free service and easy to use.
