## ⚙️ How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Three Js: For 3D model rendering
- Redux: For state management
- Firebase: For user authentication
- Linode: For hosting and for storing our data

## ☁️ Use of Linode

We have a dedicated Linode server for our backend. We use it for hosting our website and for storing our data. Linode Block Storage allows users to extend their server storage capacity with volumes on demand. Linode Backup allows us to back up their servers on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis which makes it easy and efficient. Linode allows users to manage multiple server instances across a single system.

## ⛅ Use of Google Cloud

We are using Firebase for database and authentication. Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable real-time, high-performance database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Firebase is a free service and easy to use.
